# NUSing My Brain
A tutoring web application created for NUS students by NUS students.
### Proposed Level of Achievement
Project Gemini 

## Description
NUSing My Brain is a peer-to-peer tutoring web app designed specifically for the NUS community. Our mission is to connect students seeking academic support with peers who have excelled in specific modules and can offer tailored, relatable help. Whether you're a student needing a confidence boost in your coursework or a tutor wanting to help others while reinforcing your own understanding, this platform makes it easy to connect, learn, and grow together.

## Motivation
The specialized nature of NUS courses makes it tough to find qualified tutors. Traditional tutoring services often don't have people familiar with the unique content and assessment methods we deal with here. We realize that the best tutors are often fellow students who have just completed the same modules, fully understand the curriculum, know what professors expect, and can relate to the common struggles we face.
Aim: 
To connect NUS students seeking academic assistance with qualified peer tutors who have demonstrated mastery in specific university modules.
User Stories: 
For Aspiring Peer Tutors: As a student who’s done well academically, I want a simple platform that makes it easy to connect with students who need help and set up tutoring sessions that work for both of us.

For Students Seeking Supplemental Income: As a student who wants to earn some extra cash while expanding my social circle, I want an easy-to-use system to offer tutoring services to my peers and negotiate the tuition rate with them.

For Students Facing Academic Challenges: As a student struggling with certain courses, I want to get help from approachable and trustworthy peers, who’ve already succeeded in those classes.
Scope of Project: 
The Web App provides a specialized marketplace platform that connects NUS students seeking academic assistance with qualified peer tutors who have demonstrated mastery in specific university modules.

## How are we different from similar platforms? 
### Traditional Tuition Services
 Typical tutoring platforms are geared towards general education and often lack tutors familiar with the highly specific content and assessment styles of NUS modules. These platforms do not allow filtering by university module modes or match students based on university-level academic experience.
### Telegram Study Groups or Reddit Threads
 While informal networks like Telegram groups or Reddit threads (e.g.  r/nus) exist, they are disorganized, hard to navigate, and not designed for structured academic support. Our platform offers curated tutor profiles, scheduled bookings, and credibility through reviews, which are features lacking in other platforms.
### NUS Peer Tutoring Programmes
 Existing peer tutoring services are limited in scale, usually module or faculty specific, and cannot be accessed freely by all students. Our platform removes these constraints and offers a centralized, searchable marketplace across all faculties and modules.

## Problem Motivation
The highly specialized nature of NUS courses often makes it difficult to find effective and relatable tutoring help through traditional services. These services rarely have tutors familiar with NUS-specific content, assessment formats, or the expectations of individual professors. We believe that the best tutors are often fellow NUS students—people who have just completed the modules, understand the curriculum deeply, and can empathize with the academic challenges faced.

Our platform solves this gap by enabling peer-to-peer tutoring based on recent, relevant module experience.
