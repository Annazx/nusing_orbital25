# NUSing My Brain
A tutoring web application created for NUS students by NUS students.

## Description
NUSing My Brain is a peer-to-peer tutoring web app designed specifically for the NUS community. Our mission is to connect students seeking academic support with peers who have excelled in specific modules and can offer tailored, relatable help. Whether you're a student needing a confidence boost in your coursework or a tutor wanting to help others while reinforcing your own understanding, this platform makes it easy to connect, learn, and grow together.

## Problem Motivation
The highly specialized nature of NUS courses often makes it difficult to find effective and relatable tutoring help through traditional services. These services rarely have tutors familiar with NUS-specific content, assessment formats, or the expectations of individual professors. We believe that the best tutors are often fellow NUS students—people who have just completed the modules, understand the curriculum deeply, and can empathize with the academic challenges faced.

Our platform solves this gap by enabling peer-to-peer tutoring based on recent, relevant module experience.
